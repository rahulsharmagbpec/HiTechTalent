The goal of this challenge is to get a better understanding of your mobile development and user interface design abilities. You are tasked with providing a simple sign-up form, where a user can register for an imaginary service. The form is to include inputs for the user’s first name, email address, password, and their personal website. Additionally, the user can take a profile picture. 



Requirements

• Try to make your submission look as close to the mockup as possible. 

• Please use a design architecture like MVVM or MVI to develop this app 

• Please use Kotlin (Android) or Swift (iOS) to develop this app 

• Describe the project and how to run it.



If time allows, show us your unique area of expertise, whether that is in UI/UX design, testing, architecture, etc. If you deviated or elaborated on the listed requirements, please explain the decision-making process you took, and what the benefits are.
